# Kill Team Critical Operations Deck

I didn't want to buy the new card deck - I have like 6 sets of the existing ones - so I made a small app for them instead. It's mobile friendly, and has `localStorage` so will store your saved cards.

C&C welcome, hope it comes in handy! If there's enough demand I'll whip up the mission cards.

Edit: Now with mission generator!

Edit 2: Now with all faction cards!

Edit 3: Now with a last modified timestamp, and the ability to toggle cards!

Edit 4: Now tweaked to work better as a PWA (save to Home Screen) with fancy logo :D

Edit 5: Now with a nicer URL (the old one still works though)
